                                 Mahomet.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   RUBY wine is drunk by knaves,
   Sugar spends to fatten slaves,
   Rose and vine-leaf deck buffoons;
   Thunderclouds are Jove's festoons,
   Drooping oft in wreaths of dread
   Lightning-knotted round his head;
   The hero is not fed on sweets,
   Daily his own heart he eats;
   Chambers of the great are jails,
   And head-winds right for royal sails.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
