   Let not soft nature so transformed be,
   And lose her gentler sexed humanity,
   To make me see my lord bleed. So, 'tis well;
   Never one object underneath the sun
   Will I behold before my Sophocles:
   Farewell; now teach the Romans how to die.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Mar. Dost know what 't is to die?</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Soph. Thou dost not, Martius,
   And, therefore, not what 'tis to live; to die
   Is to begin to live. It is to end
   An old, stale, weary work, and to commence
   A newer and a better. 'Tis to leave
   Deceitful knaves for the society
   Of gods and goodness. Thou thyself must part
   At last from all thy garlands, pleasures, triumphs,
   And prove thy fortitude</blockquote></div> </div>
