Already that day exists for us, shines in on us at unawares, but the path of science and of letters is not the way into nature. The idiot, the Indian, the child and unschooled farmer's boy stand nearer to the light by which nature is to be read, than the dissector or the antiquary.</p><p>SELF-RELIANCE.</p><blockquote><p>   "Ne te quaesiveris extra."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   "Man is his own star; and the soul that can
   Render an honest and a perfect man,
   Commands all light, all influence, all fate;
   Nothing to him falls early or too late.
   Our acts our angels are, or good or ill,
   Our fatal shadows that walk by us still."</p></blockquote></div> </div>
