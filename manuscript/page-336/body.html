   He loves as his own self; dear as his eye
   They are to Him: He'll never them forsake:
   When they shall die, then God himself shall die:
   They live, they live in blest eternity."
                                      Henry More.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Space is ample, east and west,
   But two cannot go abreast,
   Cannot travel in it two:
   Yonder masterful cuckoo
   Crowds every egg out of the nest,
   Quick or dead, except its own;
   A spell is laid on sod and stone,
   Night and Day 've been tampered with,
   Every quality and pith
   Surcharged and sultry with a power
   That works its will on age and hour.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
