     Places which pale passion loves,
     Moonlight walks, when all the fowls
     Are safely housed, save bats and owls,
     A midnight bell, a passing groan,â€”
     These are the sounds we feed upon."</code></pre></blockquote><p>Behold there in the wood the fine madman! He is a palace of sweet sounds and sights; he dilates; he is twice a man; he walks with arms akimbo; he soliloquizes; he accosts the grass and the trees; he feels the blood of the violet, the clover and the lily in his veins; and he talks with the brook that wets his foot.</p><p>The heats that have opened his perceptions of natural beauty have made him love music and verse. It is a fact often observed, that men have written good verses under the inspiration of passion, who cannot write well under any other circumstances.</p></div> </div>
