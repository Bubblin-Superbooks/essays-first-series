   Thou now hast found a way to conquer me.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Dor. O star of Rome! what gratitude can speak
   Fit words to follow such a deed as this?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Mar. This admirable duke, Valerius,
   With his disdain of fortune and of death,
   Captived himself, has captivated me,
   And though my arm hath ta'en his body here,
   His soul hath subjugated Martius' soul.
   By Romulus, he is all soul, I think;
   He hath no flesh, and spirit cannot be gyved;
   Then we have vanquished nothing; he is free,
   And Martius walks now in captivity.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
