<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">reform is the discovery that we must cast away our virtues, or what we have always esteemed such, into the same pit that has consumed our grosser vices:â€”</p><blockquote><pre><code>    "Forgive his crimes, forgive his virtues too,
     Those smaller faults, half converts to the right."</code></pre></blockquote><p>It is the highest power of divine moments that they abolish our contritions also. I accuse myself of sloth and unprofitableness day by day; but when these waves of God flow into me I no longer reckon lost time. I no longer poorly compute my possible achievement by what remains to me of the month or the year; for these moments confer a sort of omnipresence and omnipotence which asks nothing of duration, but sees that the energy of the mind is commensurate with the work to be done, without time.</p></div> </div>
