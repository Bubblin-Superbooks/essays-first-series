   To them I ever loved best? Now I'll kneel,
   But with my back toward thee; 'tis the last duty
   This trunk can do the gods.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Mar. Strike, strike, Valerius,
   Or Martius' heart will leap out at his mouth.
   This is a man, a woman. Kiss thy lord,
   And live with all the freedom you were wont.
   O love! thou doubly hast afflicted me
   With virtue and with beauty. Treacherous heart,
   My hand shall cast thee quick into my urn,
   Ere thou transgress this knot of piety.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
