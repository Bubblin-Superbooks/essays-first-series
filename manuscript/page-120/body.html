   Pied with morning and with night.
   Mountain tall and ocean deep
   Trembling balance duly keep.
   In changing moon, in tidal wave,
   Glows the feud of Want and Have.
   Gauge of more and less through space
   Electric star and pencil plays.
   The lonely Earth amid the balls
   That hurry through the eternal halls,
   A makeweight flying to the void,
   Supplemental asteroid,
   Or compensatory spark,
   Shoots across the neutral Dark.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Man's the elm, and Wealth the vine,
   Stanch and strong the tendrils twine:
   Though the frail ringlets thee deceive,
   None from its stock that vine can reave.
   Fear not, then, thou child infirm,
   There's no god dare wrong a worm.
   Laurel crowns cleave to deserts
   And power to him</blockquote></div> </div>
